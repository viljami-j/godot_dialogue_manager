# Dialogue Manager _for Godot 4_

Dialogue Manager is an addon for [Godot 4](https://godotengine.org/) (there's a [Godot 3 version too](https://github.com/nathanhoad/godot_dialogue_manager/tree/v1.x)) that provides a stateless branching dialogue editor and runtime. Write your dialogue in a script-like way and easily integrate it into your game.
